## AI Agent Instructions for Context Engineering Enhancements

### Before Starting Work

**1. Read CONTEXT_ENG_PROGRESS.md** to find current step:

```bash
Read file: CONTEXT_ENG_PROGRESS.md
```

**2. Check work-in-progress** section:

- If step exists in "Work In Progress", continue with it
- If no WIP step, find next step from CONTEXT_ENG_PLAN.md that's not in "Completed"

**3. Read CONTEXT_ENG_PLAN.md** for step details:

```bash
Read file: CONTEXT_ENG_PLAN.md
# Find step number to understand requirements
```

**4. Read CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md** for context engineering principles:

```bash
Read file: docs/engineering/context_engineering/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md
```

**5. Update step status** to "Work In Progress":

```markdown
### Work In Progress

- [~] **CE1. Add Context Engineering Section**
  - Status: Planning section structure
  - Started: 2025-12-30
  - Location: AGENTS.md after line ~170
  - Target: ~30 lines added
  - Reference: CONTEXT_ENG_PLAN.md Step CE1
```

### During Work

**Find relevant documentation** using this guide:

| When you need...        | Read this file...                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Context Engineering     | docs/engineering/context_engineering/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md |
| Agent Guidelines        | AGENTS.md                                                   |
| Coding Agent Guidelines | CODING_AGENTS.md                                            |
| Step Details            | CONTEXT_ENG_PLAN.md                                         |
| Current Progress        | CONTEXT_ENG_PROGRESS.md                                     |

**Key Constraints**:

- Max 150 lines added per step
- Max 3 files changed per step
- Review time < 5 minutes
- Follow strict step limits from AGENTS.md

**Use Grep tool** to find specific patterns:

```
Search for: "Agent" in AGENTS.md → Find agent descriptions to restructure
Search for: "## Core Agents" → Locate all 8 agents
Search for: "During Work" → Find section to enhance
```

### After Completing Step

**1. Move step from "Work In Progress" to "Completed"**:

```markdown
### Completed Steps

- [x] **CE1. Add Context Engineering Section**
  - Completed: 2025-12-30
  - Commit: abc1234
  - Files Changed: 1 (AGENTS.md)
  - Lines Added: ~30
  - Review Time: ~2 minutes
```

**2. Update Quick Summary table** at top:

- Update "Progress" count for current phase

**3. Add entry to Recent Activity table**:

```markdown
| 2025-12-30 | CE1 | Add Context Engineering Section | ✅ Complete | abc1234 |
```

**4. Update Next Steps** section:

- Remove completed step from "Immediate Next"
- Add next step from CONTEXT_ENG_PLAN.md

**5. Update statistics**:

- Increment completed count in Quick Summary

### Git Commit Requirements

Always follow commit message format from [docs/engineering/development/GIT_VERSION_CONTROL.md](docs/engineering/development/GIT_VERSION_CONTROL.md):

```bash
# Format: <type>[optional scope]: <description>

# Examples for context engineering work:
docs(agents): add Context Engineering section
docs(agents): restructure agents with R-G-C template
docs(agents): add Instruction Hierarchy section
docs(agents): add Guardrails section
docs(agents): implement progressive disclosure pattern
```

**Before committing**:

- ✅ Changes meet step requirements from CONTEXT_ENG_PLAN.md
- ✅ Files changed count within limits (≤ 3 files)
- ✅ Lines added within limits (≤ 150 lines)
- ✅ Commit message follows conventional commits
- ✅ Ready for review (< 5 minutes)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: AI AGENTS MUST NEVER PUSH TO GITHUB**

- **AI agents can commit locally** - Use `git commit` with proper messages
- **AI agents CANNOT push** - User must manually run `git push`
- **REASON**: Pushing requires explicit user approval and permission
- **ENFORCEMENT**: Never use `git push` command as AI agent

**After committing**:

- Update CONTEXT_ENG_PROGRESS.md with commit hash
- Move to next step only if current step is complete

---

## Quality Checkpoints

### Validation Checkpoint 1: Review Requirements

Before marking step complete:

- ⬜ All requirements from CONTEXT_ENG_PLAN.md Step CX met?
- ⬜ File changes within limits (≤ 3 files)?
- ⬜ Lines added within limits (≤ 150 lines)?
- ⬜ Review time estimate reasonable (< 5 minutes)?

### Validation Checkpoint 2: Content Review

- ⬜ Changes follow Context Engineering principles?
- ⬜ R-G-C template used correctly (if restructuring agents)?
- ⬜ Markdown headings used for structure?
- ⬜ Emphasis markers (CRITICAL, IMPORTANT) applied appropriately?
- ⬜ Links to CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md included?

### Validation Checkpoint 3: Consistency Check

- ⬜ Consistent with AGENTS.md structure?
- ⬜ Consistent with CODING_AGENTS.md guidelines?
- ⬜ Consistent with CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md principles?
- ⬜ No contradictions with existing content?

## Integration Notes

### Side Plan Status

This Context Engineering Enhancement is a **side plan** separate from the main PLAN.md workflow.

**Integration Points**:

1. AGENTS.md is updated with context engineering best practices
2. CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md provides detailed guidance
3. Main PLAN.md steps (1-310) continue unchanged
4. Main PROGRESS.md tracks steps 1-310 only
5. CONTEXT_ENG_PROGRESS.md tracks CE steps (CE1-CE18) only

**When to Update Main PROGRESS.md**:

- **Never**: Context Engineering work is tracked separately
- Main PROGRESS.md tracks only steps 1-310 from PLAN.md
- CONTEXT_ENG_PROGRESS.md tracks only CE steps from CONTEXT_ENG_PLAN.md

**File Ownership**:

- AGENTS.md: Shared (both main plan and context engineering)
- CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md: Context Engineering plan only
- CONTEXT_ENG_PLAN.md: Context Engineering plan only
- CONTEXT_ENG_PROGRESS.md: Context Engineering plan only

- Main PROGRESS.md tracks ONLY steps 1-310
- Update CONTEXT_ENG_PROGRESS.md after completing each CE step
- Follow AI Agent Workflow from AGENTS.md for each CE step
